\section{Introduction}
FireSale! is an online marketplace that wants to connect users with each other. Our goal is to simply the process of buying and selling goods and services between users. FireSale! will allow sellers to post items for sale or put on auction. Buyers will be able to buy posted items and bid on auction items. Our focus is that transactions between sellers and buys be as smooth as possible and we strive to create a platform that allows for that.\\


\noindent Our inspiration for FireSale! is based on Craigslist, a large platform where users offer services or products for sale. And bland.is, a local Icelandic web-hub similar to Craigslist but the differences lie in the emphasis on product visibility for bland.is compared to category visibility for Craigslist.\\

\noindent In this document you will find information regarding the requirements for FireSale!, interviews for our requirement analysis, use-cases, user-groups and a wireframe. Some of the data will be located in supplementary files as their format would be ill-fitted for the report.\\

\noindent All of these data points will be important for the first initial design of FireSale!.
