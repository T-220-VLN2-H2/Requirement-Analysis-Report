\section{Prototype interviews}
To gather information about the requirements, we conducted several interviews with potential user of FireSale!. The data used for our interview analysis can be found in the supplementary materials included with this report.\\

Building from the interview analysis, benchmarking and other factors, we built a wireframe containing a rough draft of how FireSale! could look like. That wireframe was then used with potential users to conduct simple usability tests, the purpose of which was to spot any obvious design errors. \\

Interviews were all conducted in Icelandic, but for the purpose of this report, the questions were translated to English. The original list can also be found within the supplementary materials included with this report.

\subsection{Interview analysis}
On the 25. of April, 2022, We interviewed 6 people regarding the creation of FireSale!. The interviewees were of different backgrounds. Interviewees were university students of different majors, a driver, dental assistant and a marketing manager. The interviewees consisted of 2 males, 4 females in an age range of 21 - 35 years of age\\\\
In our questions we asked about their experiences with digital marketplaces, how they used them in the past, what items they prefer to buy and or sell. Two of the interviewees would be likely to buy or sell more expensive items that generally last for a long time, two would be likely to sell some thing that would be considered low cost items, like children's clothing, books or decorations. One would be likely to buy likely to buy high cost items, like a vehicle or furniture but sell low cost items. The remaining two would be likely to sell items they no longer need, if they are in acceptable condition and would likely just buy anything they felt they need.\\\\
We asked the interviewees about a potential features of FireSale!. One of those is, during the posting process, the seller can place a preference on the item hand-off. 
All 6 interviewees reacted positively for this feature, some potential options they mentioned were: Pickup from seller only, negotiable hand-off location and various delivery methods. We also asked about the buyer and seller rating being visible when either looking at a product, in the case of a sellers rating. 
All of the interviewees agreed a seller's rating being visible when browsing is very important. In the case of a buyers rating, half of the interviewees agreed it isn't really important but could be helpful and the other half agreed it would be important. \\\\
In general, when asked about activities or actions on a website like FireSale! our interviewees want a great search experience with advanced filtering and clear categories. One interviewee wanted a "hold system" for products she was undecided on.\\\\
We finally asked the interviewees about a more specific feature. This feature is to handle disputes between users engaged in a sale. In general, they agreed on trying to handle any disputes directly with the seller, however our feature would include some sort of a unbiased 3rd party that would handle the disputes between the two users. Some of our interviewees included implementation details regarding the feature, which include an escrow for payments and FireSale! directly assisting in getting a refund for the seller or a payment from the buyer.\\\\
All details regarding these interviews can be found in the supplementary files included with this report.
